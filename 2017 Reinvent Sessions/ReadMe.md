| [AWS re:Invent 2017: Achieving Cybersecurity at IoT and Cloud Scale (DEM09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqwoSQLSkFY) | With the growth of IoT and cloud, the attack surface that enterprises must protect is expanding dramatically. Unique regulatory requirements by industry verticals are also placing extra pressure on security officers and their teams. How can CISOs effectively respond? First and foremost, by taking an architectural approach, one that includes network segmentation. This creates the best chance of solving enterprise security holistically and for the long term. Key capabilities must include the visibility of all security elements and the communications that these systems and devices generate and, even more importantly, the automation of operations and response. With the current cybersecurity skills gap that many enterprises experience today, the ability to quickly and effectively audit, recommend, and automatically fix the entire network security architecture is critical. Fortinet expands upon existing AWS platform security controls (IAM, segmentation, network ACLs) with advanced security capabilities (IPS, DLP, App Control, Web Filtering, Hybid VPN, Threat Research). This creates an integrated and holistic security posture. In this session, understand how technology evolution and innovation is exponentially expanding the attack surface, explore an architectural approach to network security that includes visibility and automation, and discuss strategies for quickly and effectively auditing, recommending, and repairing network security with limited resources.<br><br>Session sponsored by Fortinet |

| [AWS re:Invent 2017: Archeology Meets Architecture: Digging and Designing to Optimize (DEM63)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp2WBcLaDxc) | When planning a migration to AWS, one of the first and most seminal decisions to make is whether to lift-and-shift or first re-architect to cloud native. Unsurprisingly the right answer isn’t universal. It depends on business drivers and the state of your technology. As an email service provider, SendGrid processes over 1 billion emails daily from some of the most recognizable brands on the internet. Although we recently announced a robust and expansive relationship with AWS, we began preparing for this journey nearly two years ago. Email predates the modern notion of the cloud, so we needed to rethink some of the foundational tenets of email infrastructure to prepare for our migration to AWS. Moving from the general notion of considering business drivers and desired outcomes to the specific implications this conveyed to transition plans and implementation details, we explore the ideology and methodology that SendGrid has employed as a framework to optimize your AWS migration strategy.<br><br><br><br>Session sponsored by SendGrid |

| [AWS re:Invent 2017: Bridge to the Cloud: Using Apache Kafka to Migrate to AWS (DEM23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj2qvl9ZNSA) | Most organizations don't move to the cloud all at once. You start with a new use case, or a new application. Sometimes these applications can run independently in the cloud, but oftentimes they need data from the on-premises datacenter. After the first migration is successful, more applications follow: brand new applications start in the cloud and need some data from existing applications that are still running on-premises. Existing applications slowly migrate, but need a strategy for migrating their data in phases, an initial bulk upload often followed by incremental updates. In a mature organization, this process can take years. In this session, Apache Kafka co-creator Neha Narkhede shares how companies around the world are using Kafka to migrate to AWS. By implementing a central pipeline architecture using Apache Kafka to sync on-premises and cloud deployments, companies can accelerate migration times and reduce costs. The Kafka-centric migration process is ultimately more manageable for the organization.<br><br>Session sponsored by Confluent |

| [AWS re:Invent 2017: Hybrid Systems Management for the Enterprise (DEM08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj7KOdMTipM) | When a client’s application runs the database tier on a mainframe, and the web frontend on AWS, how integrated is their hybrid systems support? Customers see the world in terms of their application, not the platforms on which it resides. In this session, you learn the value of taking an application-level view across multiple platforms in delivering end-to-end hybrid systems management to enterprise clients. We address the need for managed service providers to develop support systems that span multiple environments including AWS, mainframe, open systems, and distributed systems. For an MSP to provide a true hybrid service, it is imperative they have a common interface, or a single pane of glass, so they can deliver support at an application rather than a platform level. With a common CMDB supporting all environments, it then becomes possible to develop intelligence in the system to use best-bet incident resolution. With this practice in place, MSPs supporting hybrid systems deliver clients a radically improved experience of the public cloud. They can deploye analytics to immediately narrow down the potential root cause of an incident from hundreds of possibilities to a few. Investigation and remediation then become far more rapid and can be delivered at a lower cost to customers. In a hybrid architecture, with two or more platforms in use for a single application, the ability to take an application-level view and develop best-bet incident resolution enable MSPs to speak in the application language of their clients, and deliver a holistic support service with economic efficiencies. As enterprise clients continue to adopt cloud-first development policies, managed service providers can assist them in their journey to AWS by removing cost and complexity from their intermediate hybrid deployments.<br><br>Session sponsored by Ensono LP |

| [AWS re:Invent 2017: NEW LAUNCH! Infinitely Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms with (MCL341)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT4tM0-7L80) | In machine learning, training large models on massive amount of data usually improved results. Our customers report, however, that training such models and deploying them is either operationally prohibitive or outright impossible for them. Amazon AI Algorithms is designed to solve this problem. It is a collection of distributed streaming ML algorithms that scale to any amount of data. They are fast and efficient because they distribute across CPU/GPU machines and share a collective distributed state via a highly-optimized parameter server. They scale to an infinite amount of data because they operate in the streaming model. This means they require only one pass over the data and never increase their resources consumption, allowing training to be paused, resumed, and snapshotted and even for algorithms to consume kinesis streams directly providing an “always on” training mechanism. They are production ready. Trained models are automatically containerized and useable in production using Amazon SageMaker hosting. Finally, we provide a convenient SDK which allows scientists to create new algorithms which operate in this model and enjoy all the benefits above.<br><br>This talk will discuss our design choices and some of the internal working of the system. It will also describe the distributed streaming model and its numerous benefits to machine learning practitioners.

| [AWS re:Invent 2017: Why Zillow Uses Email to Help Users Find Their Way Home (DEM46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfqfiRwxpJo) | Email is a critical component to every customer lifecycle journey—but when geared towards a high-value transaction, such as purchasing a home that may only happen once or twice in a lifetime, the importance increases exponentially. Deliver-ability to the inbox is critical. In a market where timing is essential (open house notifications, for example), if an email is delayed for even a few hours, it quickly becomes useless to the recipient and the sender. In this session, SparkPost talks about how delivering the right message to the right person at the right time can greatly enhance and accelerate the customer journey. Whether you are sending a hundred or a million emails a day, choosing the right email delivery service is a critical decision for your business.<br><br>Session sponsored by SparkPost |

| [AWS re:invent 2017: Models of Availability (ARC321)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc_PZ5OPXcc) | When engineering teams take on a new project, they often optimize for performance, availability, or fault tolerance. More experienced teams can optimize for these variables simultaneously. Netflix adds an additional variable: feature velocity. Most companies try to optimize for feature velocity through process improvements and engineering hierarchy, but Netflix optimizes for feature velocity through explicit architectural decisions. Mental models of approaching availability help us understand the tension between these engineering variables. For example, understanding the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity can help you decide whether to invest engineering effort into simplifying your stack or expanding the surface area of functional output. The Chaos team and the Traffic team interact with other teams at Netflix under an assumption of Essential Complexity. Incident remediation, approaches to automation, and diversity of engineering can all be understood through the perspective of these mental models. With insight and diligence, these models can be applied to improve availability over time and drift into success. |
