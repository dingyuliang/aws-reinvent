AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that makes it easy to collect, structure, and search IoT data from industrial facility databases and use it to analyze equipment and process performance. With IoT SiteWise, you can focus on understanding and optimizing your industrial operations, rather than building costly in-house data collection and management applications.
## AWS IoT Things Graph
1. Easily connect devices and web services. AWS IoT Things Graph lets you easily build IoT applications by connecting devices, such as sensors and actuators, and web services with little or no code. With AWS IoT Things Graph, it's easy to connect devices and services that weren't designed to work together.
## AWS Partner Device Catalog
1. Curated catalog of AWS-compatible IoT hardware. The AWS Device Qualification Catalog enables AWS customers to easily discover devices that work with AWS services including: Amazon FreeRTOS, AWS IoT Greengrass, AWS IoT Core, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. The AWS Device Qualification Programs enables AWS Partner Network (APN) hardware partners to self-qualify their devices and list them in the AWS Partner Device Catalog for customers to easily purchase

# MACHINE LEARNING
## Amazon Elastic Inference
1. Deep learning inference acceleration. Amazon Elastic Inference is an accelerated compute service that allows you to reduce deep learning inference costs by up to 75% when running inference using Amazon SageMaker or Amazon EC2 instances.
