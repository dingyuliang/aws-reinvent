# ANALYTICS
## Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka
1. Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data. You do not need Kafka infrastructure management expertise, so you spend less time managing infrastructure and more time building streaming applications 
## AWS Lake Formation 
1. Build a secure data lake in days.
   AWS Lake Formation is a new service in preview (coming soon) that will make it easy to set up a secure data lake in days—you will be able to ingest, catalog, clean, transform, and secure your data. AWS Lake Formation will make it easier to combine analytic tools, like Amazon EMR, Redshift, Athena, Sagemaker, and QuickSight around data in your data lake

# COMPUTE
## Amazon EC2 A1 Instance
1. Optimized for scale-out workloads. Amazon EC2 A1 instances deliver significant cost savings and are ideally suited for scale-out and Arm-based workloads that are supported by the extensive Arm ecosystem. A1 instances are the first EC2 instances powered by AWS Graviton Processors that feature 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores and custom silicon designed by AWS.
## Amaazon EC2 C5n Instances
1. Up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth. Amazon EC2 C5n instances are the latest addition to the C5 family and provide up to 100 Gbps of networking throughput. C5n instances are ideal for network intensive applications including high performance computing workloads, data lakes, and network appliances such as firewalls and routers
## Amazon EC2 P3dn Instances
1. Optimized for distributed ML training. Amazon EC2 P3dn.24xlarge instances are the fastest, most powerful, and largest P3 instance size available and provide up to 100 Gbps of networking throughput, 8 NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 GPUs with 32 GB of memory each, 96 custom Intel® Xeon® Scalable (Skylake) vCPUs, and 2 TB of local NVMe-based SSD storage. The faster networking, new processors, doubling of GPU memory, and additional vCPUs enable developers to significantly lower the time to train their ML models or run more HPC simulations by scaling out their jobs across several instances (e.g., 16, 32 or 64 instances).
## AWS Outposts
1. Run AWS infrastruture on-premises. AWS Outposts bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.
